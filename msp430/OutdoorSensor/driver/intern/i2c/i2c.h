 * @brief I2C implemtation for MSP430G2553, interrupt based.
 * @n This implemtation based on examples from Texas Instruments slaa382.
 * @n For more information see link below.
 * @see http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa382/slaa382.zip
 *
 * @todo Find a better way for continue i2c_write_arr() after transmittion on repeated start condition.
 * @n Implement error detection, for example wrong configuration for prescale or detect non existing slave.
